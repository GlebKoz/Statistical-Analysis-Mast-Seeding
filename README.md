# Statistical-Analysis-Mast-Seeding
Statistical Analysis of Mast Seeding: Exploration of the ecological phenomenon of mast seeding through climate and tree reproduction data, featuring a novel threshold algorithm and robust statistical tests.

**Dataset: MASTREE_climate_2.csv**

MASTREE_climate_2.csv contains about a half of the original [MASTREE dataset](https://mastreeplus.shinyapps.io/mastreeplus/) together with corresponding climate variables that I obtained.

**Mastree RMDs**

1) Masting1--functions for climate and get address.Rmd

This RMD has functions I was using to get climate data and add it to masting data.


2) masting2--define mast years, compute mast periods.Rmd


This RMD has initial versions of masting threshold functions, UPDATED versions of masting threshold functions, function to compute mast periods (intervals between mast years), as well as visual exploration of how well these functions work.


3) Masting3--Initial Statistical Analysis.Rmd

This RMD contains my initial attempts to statistical analysis. 

**Stats RMDs**

1) Stats--picea engelmannii.Rmd

This RMD contains statistical analysis of correelation between masting and temperature for Picea Engelmanii

2) Stats--pinus sylvestris.Rmd

This RMD contains statistical analysis of correelation between masting and temperature for Pinus Sylvestris

**PDFs of RMDs**

Folder contains knitted PDFs of selected RMD files. Plots can be seen there.
